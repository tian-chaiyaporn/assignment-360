# Bill Calculator

This is the completed project for an assessment challenge by a company. It is a frontend project for calculating final bill based on rules that are dependent on factors such as coupons and total bill.

This project was started with create-react-app, and the rest was developed by myself.

## Start
To get started:

* Please Clone and Install, then start the app:
    - `npm install`
    - `yarn start`
    - or `npm start`
* To start developing, start it up, and use the following scripts for tests and watching scss:
    - `yarn test`
    - and in a different window/tab: `npm run watch-css`
